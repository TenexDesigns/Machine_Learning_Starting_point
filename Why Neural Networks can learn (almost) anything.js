To understanfd How a neural Netwotk can Lear anything at all


  We nned Stor Start at FUNCTIONS

    What is a function



      Funtion is a system of inputs and outputes, Numbers in And Numbers outs


              x -----> f(x)   ----->



numbers in    -----> Function -----> Numbers out

                In the aboeve Case , you input X and the function outputs Y

                  You can plot all the x and y values on a graph to give you a line
                    What is important to know is that , as long as you know the function , you can always calculate thecorrect  output y, for any input x

                      But say , we dont kow the function, but we only know some of its x and y values, we know the inputs and outputs ,but we don t know the function used to produce them
                        Is there a way to reverse engineer that function that produce this data,
                          If we could contrusct such a function, we could use it to calculate a y value given an x value that is not within our original dataset
                          To construct this function, we need a function aprrocimation, called Funtion Aproximator, That is what a neural network is   --> f(x) = T(x)
