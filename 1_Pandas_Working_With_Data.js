Certainly! Heres an explanation of each task with code samples using pandas:

Iterate through each Row:
To iterate through each row in a DataFrame, you can use the iterrows() method. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Iterate through each row
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    # Access row values
    print(row['column1'], row['column2'])
In this example, df is the DataFrame you want to iterate through. You can access the values of each column in the row using the column names.

Getting rows based on a specific condition:
To filter rows based on a specific condition, you can use boolean indexing. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Get rows where column1 is greater than 10
filtered_df = df[df['column1'] > 10]
In this example, df is the DataFrame, and column1 is the column you want to filter. The resulting filtered_df will contain only the rows where the condition is True.

High-Level description of your data:
To obtain a high-level description of your data, you can use the describe() method. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Get high-level description
description = df.describe()
print(description)
The describe() method provides statistics such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum value, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value for each numeric column in the DataFrame.

Sorting Values:
To sort the DataFrame based on specific columns, you can use the sort_values() method. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Sort DataFrame by column1 in ascending order
sorted_df = df.sort_values('column1')

# Sort DataFrame by column2 in descending order
sorted_df = df.sort_values('column2', ascending=False)
In the first example, sorted_df will contain the DataFrame sorted by the values in column1 in ascending order. In the second example, sorted_df will be sorted by the values in column2 in descending order.

Making Changes to the DataFrame:
To make changes to the DataFrame, you can directly assign values to specific cells or columns. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Change value of a specific cell
df.loc[row_label, 'column_name'] = new_value

# Change values in a specific column
df['column_name'] = new_values
In the first line, you can replace row_label and column_name with the specific row label and column name of the cell you want to modify. In the second line, column_name should be replaced with the name of the column you want to modify, and new_values should be a list or array of the new values.

Adding a Column:
To add a new column to the DataFrame, you can simply assign values to a new column name. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Add a new column
df['new_column'] = new_values
Replace new_column with the desired name for the new column and new_values with the values you want to assign to that column.

Deleting a Column:
To delete a column from the DataFrame, you can use the drop() method. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Delete a column
df.drop('column_name', axis=1, inplace=True)
Replace column_name with the name of the column you want to delete. The axis=1 parameter specifies that the operation should be performed on columns, and inplace=True ensures that the changes are made directly to the DataFrame.

Summing Multiple Columns to Create a New Column:
To sum multiple columns and create a new column with the total, you can use the sum() function along with column selection. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Sum multiple columns and create a new column
df['total'] = df['column1'] + df['column2'] + df['column3']
Replace column1, column2, column3 with the names of the columns you want to sum. The resulting column total will contain the sum of the selected columns.

These are some common operations in pandas for working with data. Remember to adapt the code samples to your specific DataFrame and column names.

  Here are code samples for the tasks you mentioned in Pandas:

Iterate through each row: You can use iterrows() to iterate through each row of a DataFrame (pythonexamples.org):
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cathy'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 35]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

for index, row in df.iterrows():
    print(index, ':', row['Name'], 'is', row['Age'], 'years old.')
Getting rows based on a specific condition: Use boolean indexing to filter rows based on a condition (geeksforgeeks.org):
# Get rows where Age is greater than 25
result = df[df['Age'] > 25]
print(result)
High Level description of your data: Use the describe() method to get a summary of the main statistics of your data ():
# Get summary statistics of the 'Age' column
print(df['Age'].describe())
Sorting Values: Use the sort_values() method to sort the DataFrame values ():
# Sort by 'Name' alphabetically
df_sorted = df.sort_values('Name')

# Sort by 'Age' numerically
df_sorted = df.sort_values('Age')
Making Changes to the DataFrame: Modify specific cells or columns using .loc[], .iloc[], or assignment operators (sparkbyexamples.com):
# Modify a specific cell
df.loc[0, 'Name'] = 'Alex'

# Modify an entire column
df['Age'] = df['Age'] + 1
Adding a column: Use the assignment operator to add a new column with values (stackoverflow.com):
# Add a new column 'City'
df['City'] = ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'San Francisco']
Deleting a column: Use the drop() method to remove a column (stackoverflow.com):
# Delete the 'City' column
df = df.drop('City', axis=1)
Summing multiple columns to create a new column: Use the assignment operator and sum the desired columns (interviewqs.com):
data = {'A': [1, 2, 3],
        'B': [4, 5, 6]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a new column 'C' as the sum of columns 'A' and 'B'
df['C'] = df['A'] + df['B']
These code samples demonstrate various tasks you can perform with Pandas DataFrames.
