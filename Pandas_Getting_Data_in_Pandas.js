Pandas provides convenient functions to import data from various file formats, including CSV, Excel, and text files. Here's how you can import data from each of these formats:

CSV (Comma-Separated Values):
To import data from a CSV file, you can use the pd.read_csv() function. For example, if your CSV file is named "data.csv", you can import it as follows:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
This will read the contents of the CSV file into a DataFrame named df.

Excel:
To import data from an Excel file, you need to use the pd.read_excel() function. Make sure you have the openpyxl library installed, which is required for reading Excel files. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel("data.xlsx", sheet_name="Sheet1")
In this example, "data.xlsx" is the name of the Excel file, and "Sheet1" is the name of the sheet from which you want to import data. You can specify the sheet name or index.

Text Files:
For text files with delimited values, such as tab-separated values (TSV) or other custom delimiters, you can use the pd.read_csv() function with additional parameters. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data.txt", delimiter="\t")
In this example, "data.txt" is the name of the text file, and delimiter="\t" specifies that the values are tab-separated. You can customize the delimiter based on your file format.

Additionally, pandas provides functions for importing data from other formats, such as SQL databases, JSON files, and more. You can explore the pandas documentation for more details on importing data from different sources.

To import data from various file formats into Pandas, you can use the following functions:

CSV files: Use pd.read_csv() to read CSV files into a DataFrame. You can also specify data types and parse dates as needed. For example:
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv", index_col=0, dtype=dtypes, parse_dates=['IND_DAY'])
(realpython.com)

Excel files: To read Excel files (.xlsx format), you can use pd.read_excel(). First, make sure to install the required packages:
pip install pandas
pip install openpyxl
Then, you can read the Excel file like this:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_excel("sample.xlsx")
You can also select a particular column by passing the index_col parameter (geeksforgeeks.org).

Text files: To read text files (.txt or other plain text formats) with delimiter-separated values, you can use pd.read_csv() by specifying the appropriate delimiter using the sep parameter. For example, if the text file uses tab-separated values:
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.txt", sep="\t")
By using these functions, you can easily import data from various file formats into Pandas DataFrames for further analysis and manipulation.
