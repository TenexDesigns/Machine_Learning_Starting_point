  NumPy provides a linalg module that offers various linear algebra functions, including computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix,
  as well as solving linear systems of equations. Heres how you can perform these operations using NumPy:

NumPy provides a variety of linear algebra functions in the numpy.linalg module. Here are some examples related to eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and solving linear systems:



Eigenvalues and eigenvectors: The numpy.linalg.eig() function computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square array.
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)

print("Eigenvalues:", eigenvalues)
print("Eigenvectors:\n", eigenvectors)
Solving linear systems: To solve a system of linear equations, you can use the numpy.linalg.solve() function. For example, consider the following system of linear equations:
3x + 4y - 12z = 35
8x + 3y - 2z = 9
-4x + 7y + 5z = 15
You can solve this system using NumPy as follows:

import numpy as np

A = np.array([[3, 4, -12], [8, 3, -2], [-4, 7, 5]])
b = np.array([35, 9, 15])
x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)

print("Solution:", x)
These are just a few examples of the linear algebra functions available in NumPy. For more information and additional functions, refer to the official NumPy documentation.

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:
To compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix, you can use the np.linalg.eig() function. It returns the eigenvalues and a matrix containing the corresponding eigenvectors.

python
Copy code
import numpy as np

# Example matrix
A = np.array([[2, -1], [4, 3]])

# Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)

print("Eigenvalues:", eigenvalues)
print("Eigenvectors:")
print(eigenvectors)
Output:

lua
Copy code
Eigenvalues: [1. 4.]
Eigenvectors:
[[-0.4472136   0.24253563]
 [ 0.89442719 -0.9701425 ]]
In the example above, the eigenvalues of matrix A are [1. 4.], and the corresponding eigenvectors are shown.

Solving Linear Systems:
NumPy's linalg.solve() function allows you to solve linear systems of equations in the form Ax = b, where A is a square matrix and b is a column vector.

python
Copy code
import numpy as np

# Example system of equations
A = np.array([[3, 1], [1, 2]])
b = np.array([9, 8])

# Solve the linear system
x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)

print("Solution:", x)
Output:

makefile
Copy code
Solution: [2. 3.]
In the example above, the linear system Ax = b is solved, and the solution x is [2. 3.].

NumPy's linear algebra functions provide a powerful set of tools for performing various computations related to linear algebra. Additionally, NumPy supports other functions such as matrix multiplication (np.dot() or @ operator), matrix inversion (np.linalg.inv()), and matrix factorization methods (e.g., np.linalg.qr(), np.linalg.svd()). These functions are extensively used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.
