Certainly! Here's an explanation of each task in pandas:

Summing Multiple Columns to Create a New Column:
To sum multiple columns and create a new column with the total, you can use the sum() function along with column selection. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Sum multiple columns and create a new column
df['total'] = df['column1'] + df['column2'] + df['column3']
Replace column1, column2, column3 with the names of the columns you want to sum. The resulting column total will contain the sum of the selected columns.

Rearranging Columns:
To rearrange columns in a DataFrame, you can use indexing and assignment. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Rearrange columns
df = df[['column2', 'column1', 'column3']]
Replace column1, column2, column3 with the desired order of the columns. The DataFrame will be rearranged accordingly.

Saving Data:
To save your DataFrame to a file, you can use various functions based on the file format. Here are some examples:
Saving to CSV: df.to_csv('file.csv', index=False)
Saving to Excel: df.to_excel('file.xlsx', index=False)
Saving to TXT: df.to_csv('file.txt', sep='\t', index=False)
Replace 'file.csv', 'file.xlsx', 'file.txt' with the desired file path and name.
Filtering Data based on Multiple Conditions:
To filter data based on multiple conditions, you can combine conditions using logical operators (& for AND, | for OR). Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Filter data based on multiple conditions
filtered_df = df[(df['column1'] > 10) & (df['column2'] < 5)]
Replace column1, column2 with the desired column names, and modify the conditions as needed. The resulting filtered_df will contain rows that satisfy all the specified conditions.

Reset Index:
To reset the index of a DataFrame, you can use the reset_index() method. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Reset index
df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
The drop=True parameter is used to drop the old index column, and inplace=True ensures that the changes are made directly to the DataFrame.

Regex Filtering:
To filter data based on textual patterns using regular expressions, you can use the str.contains() method. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Regex filtering
filtered_df = df[df['column'].str.contains(r'pattern', regex=True)]
Replace column with the desired column name, and pattern with the regular expression pattern you want to match.

Conditional Changes:
To make conditional changes to specific cells or columns based on certain conditions, you can use the loc indexer. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Conditional changes
df.loc[df['column'] > 10, 'column'] = new_value
Replace column with the desired column name, and new_value with the value you want to assign to cells that satisfy the condition.

Aggregate Statistics using Groupby:
To compute aggregate statistics (such as sum, mean, count) based on groups, you can use the groupby() function. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Aggregate statistics using groupby
grouped_data = df.groupby('group_column')['value_column'].sum()
Replace group_column with the column you want to group by, and value_column with the column you want to perform the aggregation on. You can use functions like sum(), mean(), count(), etc., to compute the desired statistics.

Working with Large Amounts of Data:
When working with large amounts of data, you can use the chunksize parameter while reading the data to process it in smaller chunks. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Working with large data using chunksize
chunk_iter = pd.read_csv('file.csv', chunksize=1000)
for chunk in chunk_iter:
    # Perform operations on each chunk
    # ...
Replace 'file.csv' with the path to your large data file, and adjust the chunksize parameter as needed. The data will be processed in smaller chunks, allowing you to handle large datasets efficiently.

These are some common operations in pandas for working with data. Adapt the code samples to your specific DataFrame, column names, and requirements.

Here are code samples for the tasks you mentioned in Pandas:

Iterate through each row: You can use iterrows() to iterate through each row of a DataFrame (pythonexamples.org):
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cathy'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 35]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

for index, row in df.iterrows():
    print(index, ':', row['Name'], 'is', row['Age'], 'years old.')
Getting rows based on a specific condition: Use boolean indexing to filter rows based on a condition (geeksforgeeks.org):
# Get rows where Age is greater than 25
result = df[df['Age'] > 25]
print(result)
High Level description of your data: Use the describe() method to get a summary of the main statistics of your data ():
# Get summary statistics of the 'Age' column
print(df['Age'].describe())
Sorting Values: Use the sort_values() method to sort the DataFrame values ():
# Sort by 'Name' alphabetically
df_sorted = df.sort_values('Name')

# Sort by 'Age' numerically
df_sorted = df.sort_values('Age')
Making Changes to the DataFrame: Modify specific cells or columns using .loc[], .iloc[], or assignment operators (sparkbyexamples.com):
# Modify a specific cell
df.loc[0, 'Name'] = 'Alex'

# Modify an entire column
df['Age'] = df['Age'] + 1
Adding a column: Use the assignment operator to add a new column with values (stackoverflow.com):
# Add a new column 'City'
df['City'] = ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'San Francisco']
Deleting a column: Use the drop() method to remove a column (stackoverflow.com):
# Delete the 'City' column
df = df.drop('City', axis=1)
Summing multiple columns to create a new column: Use the assignment operator and sum the desired columns (interviewqs.com):
data = {'A': [1, 2, 3],
        'B': [4, 5, 6]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a new column 'C' as the sum of columns 'A' and 'B'
df['C'] = df['A'] + df['B']
These code samples demonstrate various tasks you can perform with Pandas DataFrames.
